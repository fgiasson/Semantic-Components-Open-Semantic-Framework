== Introduction ==

The demo folder contains one folder for each semantic component at work. To run the demo, you have to run each
index.html file within your browser.

The first step is to compile the PortableControlApplication in debug mode. Once compiled, the 
PortableControlComponent.swf file should appear in the /bin-debug/ folder. It is the executable file that the
demos will use to run the semantic components.



== Notes ==

For the sMap component, you will need an internet connection in order to be able to download the
map files from our servers.
